# inheritance, week 5
This exercise goal is to implement an program that simulates a natural genetic behavior;
To solve this, a consistent pointer and struct knowledgement is needed, once it uses specific data structures (nodes specifically), that points to other struct;
The solving part was easy personally, once I exercited the recursion concept in past exercises, but not only this, the program uses memory management concepts and a new way to access properties of a struct;
