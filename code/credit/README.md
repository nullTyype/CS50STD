# credit, week 1
At this exercise, the goal is to implement a card validation system based at some patterns that surrounds credit card numbers;
The validations are a lotta primitive once I was starting the language. Was used length of the card and some specific chars I turned into integers for properly validation;
The most interesting part was the math I needed to do because of card code validation, having to iterates over each char 
{ mult += arr[0] - '0' + arr [1] - '0' } typecasting chars to integers for easy compare;
