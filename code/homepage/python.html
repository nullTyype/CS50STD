                <h2>The Language Itself</h2>
                <hr>
                I was firstly introduced to Python at CS50 classes, even knowing it's existence and seeing a bunch of projects using it I've got surprises with the pythonian way of do things, the language has an unique way it's logic works that got me confused at first look because the syntax is pretty strange and even don't know much of python, I know I've got to have more contact with this because it's interesting after all.<br>
                I've heard Python isn't that good for machine learning at all but don't have sufficient knowledge to complain about this, don't know nothing about this topic but I will someday since interest me a lot.<br>
                The way we can deal with CSV and SQL using Python is a knowledge I ever wanted to but didn't know until I did contact with it, it's easy to manipulate but complex things can be built using these, surely it was worth it.<br>
                <br>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <hr>
                My entire projects in Python was made to CS50 and it's pretty good IDE support to the language at VScode, the problems are mainly the sentimental ones and world-cup. Also is pleases me work with SQL and Python together.<br>
                Other interesting topic is that next year (2023) they're going to release a proper GPT as a 24/7 teacher which I'm going to test for sure.
