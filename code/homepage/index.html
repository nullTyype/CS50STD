            The purpose of this, beyond make a homepage for <i>CS50</i> problem set, it's kinda of a therapy for me. <br>
            Both for reminding me of which projects I've already made for help myself figure out at where point I am at my career
            and for serve as a lembrance when I revisit it over the years.
            It's been 6 months since I began this course (even having doubts about it's real efficiency) and was a totally unique experience the way <i>CS50</i> teaches it's content,
            both the exercises that are made to make you think hard (tideman can vouch for that) with specific topic that together make the knowledgement a lot much tactile and also for David Malan's communication which is (for real) one of the best I've ever seen.<br>
            (imagine code, organize, say and interact with the students all at the same time by 2 hours and half making the lowest count of errors possible)<br>
            The pages are listed at the sticky navbar over all the pages, where you can navigate over all of them and of course have access to it's content.
