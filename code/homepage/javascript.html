                <h2>The Language Itself</h2>
                <hr>
                Javascript probably was the first language I've had contact. With markup languages as HTML and CSS was the tool I used to begin at web development by around 2018 trying course tutorials at youtube and later taking Gustavo Guanabara's course of Javascript, what made me be an step back of programming courses once I'm naturally an self-taught student and just watch following teacher steps doesn't please me.<br>
                What interest me in JS is the flexibility of the language combined with it's facility to see results, using the modules way to do things using the web is a totally different experience from building JS the common way. <br>
                <br>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <hr>
                Most of the projects I've made using JS are simple and not that interesting, most of them to test libs and other to practice the language, the most interesting was a music player as shown bellow where I used JS modules as said earlier to build another way to glue all the project's pieces together.
