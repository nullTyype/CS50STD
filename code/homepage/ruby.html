                <h2>The Language Itself</h2>
                <hr>
                Ruby is my main language since i've been introduced to it by Fabio Akita's YT channel around 2020, it's syntax and the way the things works pleases me a lot, the logic is pretty fluid and the language is pretty semantic.<br>
                But it's impossible to talk about ruby without mentioning it's community, things like Lucky with it's (poignant) guide to ruby and all their contributions to the application's development as a whole, specially with it's most popular framework Rails which was the first framework I dealt with.<br>
                <br>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <hr>
                The projects I've made in ruby are pretty turned to the logic itself. Personally I like IJR one a lot, once it took various hours to solve the problems that are all from Guilherme Silvera's "From logic to Games using Ruby" with some addictions I've made after finish the ebook.
                <br> Other important topic are the rails framework projects which I learned a lot with: from routes until MVC arquitecture, the way I went introduced wasn't one of the bests: taking an udemy course and getting frustrated when trying to do by myself!
                After this I quit the course to learn with the official documentation, which was lotta better for me which turned to be the way I learn things today.
