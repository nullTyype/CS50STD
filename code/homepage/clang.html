                <h2>The Language Itself</h2>
                <hr>
                I've heard of C language in the past when I was starting programming and at first look it was pretty complicated (I can ensure this) than ruby but not only this, the C language gives a powerful low level control to the programmer, it has interested me in the language since the beggining of my process to learn my first language which was Ruby, but only after beggining the <i>CS50</i> study with C and use it for a bunch of weeks it become one of my main languages. <br>
                The C lang linearity pleases me because of it's solid logic, where we must build almost everything from scratch using memory management and pointer which against the common view I also like a lot to build with <br>
                Regardless the points I like in C, what helped me in most to really understand more about C surely was <i>CS50</i>'s didacts which as it's said at homepage, is one of the best I've ever had contact.<br>
                <br>
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <hr>
                I have made a lot of projects written with C of all types, most of them writen to solve <i>CS50</i> problems as apply filter to images, use recursion to resolve an tideman election, an program that simulates ginealogic trees, work with CSV files, using nodes, linked lists, hash tables, tries, tree structs, the base concepts of object-oriented languages, learned about data structures, pointers, memory management and mainly, improved my problem solve capacity and got an higher embracing of web development on general.
