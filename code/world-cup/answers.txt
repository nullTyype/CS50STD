Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: the program becomes more accurate based at rating according N gets closer from infinite;

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 10000, because it is good enough to give an correct range of the winners,
takes approximatelly 3 times more than it's previous simulation (1000) even realizing 10 times more simulations,
different from it's successor that takes around 8 times to simulates, realizing the same 10 times more simulations;
