### Bits
**Once computer just have 2 states of the simplest bit of information (0,1: On and Off), the way we use to count numbers are the presence (or not) of these at the CPU "information chunk" at certain time period; <br/>
Example of computer binary representation:**<br/>
<p align = "center">
    8 4 2 1 <br/>
    1 0 0 0 = 8 <br/>
    8 4 2 1 <br/>
    1 1 0 0 = 12<br/>
</p>
